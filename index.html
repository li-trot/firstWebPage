        <h3>–êuture web developer</h3>
        <p>I like learning programming languages because they give me the freedom
          to create useful applications and give me more understanding of the modern world.
          I like being part of a large community that pushes humanity to a new stage.</p>
        <p> It's amazing to see how lines of code turn into something visible and beautiful, 
          I like this power, it's enough to have a good imagination and the necessary set of knowledge,
          and you can do whatever you want</p>

        <dd>It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is,
          it performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.</dd>
        <dt>ASCII</dt>
        <dd>It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers,
          so it is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.</dd>
        <dt>Random-access memory</dt>
        <dd>It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase the general
          speed of a system. It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time
          irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.</dd>
        <dt>Programming Languages</dt>
        <dd>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output.
          They generally consist of instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs that implement specific
          algorithms.</dd>
        <dt>Domain Name System</dt>
        <dd>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet
